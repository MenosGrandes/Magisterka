This repository contains my master's thesis. <br />
This thesis  is about creating  flowers/trees using L-system in 2d and 3d.<br />
I have used Logger for c++ applications :<br/>
https://github.com/easylogging/easyloggingpp/blob/master/README.md#logging-format-specifiers<br/>
JSON reader for c++:<br/>
https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson<br/><br/>

I would like to change lib from SFML to pure OpenGL(c++) and WebGL(JavaScript)
Insted of replacing the char one by one i will use http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/regex_replace - TODO
Or using the 'replace_all_copy' function from boost.
